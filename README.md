# React fullstack project with database (mysql) 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Reactodo app with frontend, backend and api. Leart HTTP calls, full stack structure, sql prompting, javascript syntax, a lot of troubleshooting, setting up servers with node, and more. 
There's more i could do, like implementing re-fetching when submitting form, making it prettier, making a "delete all marked" button and stuff. Gonna do something else now. 


Note to self:
npm run start
cd backend 
node backend.js
mysql.server start
brew services start mysql
mysql -u root -p
